## 🎯 Overview

This React Native application demonstrates how to integrate generative AI capabilities into mobile apps for product recommendation use cases. Users can input natural language queries describing their needs, and the application provides intelligent product recommendations with explanations.

**Live Demo:** [AI Product Advisor Web Version](https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/fe4f2cd9fd78f0017c8d31eb08d226f4/7af7bedb-2728-4d38-be95-2ece9c7f902c/index.html)

## 🏗 Architecture

### High-Level Component Structure

```
AI Product Advisor App
├── App.js (Root Component)

- **Search Optimization**: Keywords and categories for matching

## 🛠 Setup & Installation

### For Expo Snack Development

1. **Open Expo Snack**: Navigate to [snack.expo.dev](https://snack.expo.dev)
2. **Create New Project**: Start with a blank React Native template
3. **Import Files**: Copy the provided code structure
4. **Set Dependencies**: Add required packages in package.json
5. **Configure Environment**: Set up Gemini API key (see AI Integration section)

### Required Dependencies

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "18.2.0",
    "react-native": "0.74.5",
    "@google/generative-ai": "^0.19.0",
    "expo": "~51.0.28"
  }
}
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

## 🤖 AI Integration

### Gemini API Integration

The application integrates with Google's Gemini AI for intelligent product recommendations:

```javascript
import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from '@google/generative-ai';

const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY);
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-1.5-flash' });

// Prompt engineering for product recommendations
const prompt = `
You are an expert product advisor. Based on the user's query: "${userQuery}"
Analyze these products and recommend the 3 most suitable ones:
${JSON.stringify(productCatalog)}

Respond with JSON containing recommended products and explanations.
`;
```

### Prompt Engineering Strategy

The application uses sophisticated prompt engineering techniques:

1. **Role Assignment**: "You are an expert product advisor"
2. **Context Provision**: Complete product catalog with metadata
3. **Clear Instructions**: Specific format for responses
4. **Few-Shot Examples**: Sample queries and expected outputs
5. **Constraint Setting**: Limit to top 3 recommendations

### API Security Best Practices

- **Environment Variables**: API keys stored securely using `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents excessive API calls
- **Input Validation**: Sanitizes user input before processing

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### UI/UX Philosophy

**Clean & Professional**: Modern card-based design with consistent spacing
**Mobile-First**: Optimized for touch interfaces and small screens  
**Loading States**: Clear feedback during AI processing
**Error Recovery**: Helpful error messages and retry options

### State Management

Using React's built-in hooks for simplicity:
- `useState` for component state (input, results, loading)
- `useEffect` for side effects (API calls, cleanup)
- Local state management (no Redux needed for this scope)

### Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy Loading**: Products rendered only when needed
- **Memoization**: Prevent unnecessary re-renders of ProductCard components
- **Debounced Search**: Prevent excessive API calls during typing
- **Efficient Re-renders**: Minimize state updates and component updates

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
1. **User Profiles**: Save preferences and search history
2. **Product Filtering**: Price range, category, brand filters
3. **Comparison Tool**: Side-by-side product comparison
4. **Wishlist**: Save favorite products for later
5. **Reviews Integration**: User reviews and ratings

### AI Improvements
1. **Learning Algorithm**: Improve recommendations based on user interactions
2. **Multi-modal Input**: Image-based product search
3. **Conversational Interface**: Follow-up questions and refinements
4. **Personalization**: Tailored recommendations based on history

### Technical Enhancements
1. **Offline Support**: Cache recommendations for offline viewing
2. **Push Notifications**: New product alerts and recommendations
3. **Analytics Integration**: Track user behavior and preferences
4. **A/B Testing**: Test different recommendation algorithms

## 💻 Development Notes
